# Global Community Hiking Trails Reviews

## Project Objectives
There is a community of hikers out there who'd love to hike wherever they go and they all share the same love of hiking and nature with each other. This site 
is a dedication to the love of hiking and in hope to allow the global community to share their experience be it in joy or in frustrations of their time during 
their hike.

## UX/UI
### Overview and Colour
The colour chosen for this website is base on nature theme. The navbar is chosen to have a dark green colour to match the image on the parallax.
The colour of the background (the html body) is chosen to be light yellow, to give some colour to the site as well as to make the cards stand out.
This colour is also chosen, to give the site a bright feel. 
The cards are chosen to be white to make the text and content stand out.

### User Stories
1. The user, as a hiking enthusiast, would like to browse trails by countries and location to enable him/her to plan his/her hiking trip on his/her visit to that country.
2. The user should be able to see a directory of all the trails available.
3. The user should be able to search for a specific term in the search bar.
4. The user should be able to register to create a profile on the site.
5. The user should be able to manage his/her profile on the site.
6. The user should be able to post as well as rate the hiking trip, edit and delete his/her comments on the site.
7. The user presumably would want to see the trails sorted by ratings.

### Wireframes
